# AutonomousCar
Considering a given card, allows to identify recharging stations compatible with the car (Gasoline, Hybrid, electric).
v1.0. Allows to display an interface in the terminal that allows to find and calculate the length of the shortest path between two points on the map using the Dijkstra algorithm. This version also allows us to find the longest path a car can travel without having to recharge or fill up.
Useful notions : 
- Weighted oriented graphs
- Recursivity
- Dijkstra Algorithm
- STL

INCOMING : Version with an GUI.
